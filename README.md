# 📊 Customer_Churn_Analysis – End-to-End Data Analytics Project

### 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using an end-to-end data analytics workflow. The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and present actionable business insights using SQL, Power BI, and Python.
The project simulates a real-world analytics scenario followed in MNC data teams, covering data extraction, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

### 🗂️ Dataset

* Customer churn dataset (CSV format).
  
* Contains customer demographics, service usage, billing details, and churn status.

* Dataset was loaded into SQL Server for analysis.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) – Data loading & SQL-based EDA.

* SQL – Data cleaning, aggregation, and business analysis.

* Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation.

* Python – Data preprocessing & churn prediction model.

* Jupyter Notebook – Model development & evaluation.

### 🔍 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (SSMS)

* Performed detailed EDA using SQL to:

* Check data quality (NULL values, duplicates)

* Analyze churn distribution

* Identify churn trends across:

  * Customer tenure

  * Services used

  * Contract type

  * Monthly charges
  
* Create aggregated views to support dashboard metrics.

### 📈 Power BI Dashboard

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:

* Overall churn rate.

* Churn by contract type, tenure, and services.

* Customer segmentation insights.

* Key KPIs for business decision-making.

### 🤖 Machine Learning (Churn Prediction)

* Built a churn prediction model using Random Forest

* Performed:

  * Feature encoding

  * Train-test split

  * Model evaluation

* Used the model to predict churn on new/unseen customer data

### ✅ Key Outcomes

* Identified major drivers of customer churn

* Delivered business-friendly insights through dashboards

* Demonstrated strong integration of SQL, BI, and ML workflows

* Built a project aligned with real-world data analyst expectations

### 🚀 How to Run the Project

* Load the dataset into SQL Server

* Execute SQL queries from eda_queries.sql

* Open the Power BI file to explore dashboards

* Run the Jupyter Notebook for churn predictions
